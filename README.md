The Airline Booking System is a Flask-based API designed to simulate a real-world airline booking experience by enabling users to search for flights, book tickets, manage reservations, track flight statuses, and leave reviews. The system follows RESTful API principles, ensuring efficient communication between the front-end and back-end components. It is built using Python (Flask) for the backend, MongoDB for storing flight and user data, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. API testing and debugging are handled using Postman.

The system offers several key functionalities. User authentication ensures that only registered users with valid credentials can access the API, with an access token generated upon login. Flight management allows admins to add, update, or delete flights, while users can search flights based on departure, destination, and date. Booking management enables users to select flights, enter passenger details, and confirm reservations. Additionally, flight status updates allow admins to change flight statuses (On Time, Delayed, or Canceled), and users can check these updates via the API. Lastly, the reviews and ratings system lets users submit, update, and delete reviews, including ratings (1-5 stars) and comments.

The API consists of key endpoints, such as registering a user (POST /register), logging in and receiving an authentication token (POST /login), retrieving flight details (GET /flights and GET /flights/{id}), booking flights (POST /bookings), retrieving booking details (GET /bookings/{id}), updating flight statuses (PUT /flights/{flight_id}/status), and canceling bookings (DELETE /bookings/{id}). These endpoints allow seamless interaction between users and the system while maintaining security and efficiency.

To set up the project, users need to clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project folder, install dependencies using pip, run the Flask application, and finally test the API using Postman or Curl. This project provides a well-structured and secure approach to airline booking systems, ensuring a smooth experience for both administrators and passengers.
